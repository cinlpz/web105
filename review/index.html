      Takt Op. Symphonica is a RPG, turn-based game developed by DeNA and Bandai
      Namco Arts. The game is relatively new as it was launched in 2023. As of
      now DeNA has continued to release new characters and with the help of the
      artist LAM, continued to deliver amazing game visuals. However, some
      players find the game a bit boring. Even though the art is great, the
      gameplay gets repetitive because every battle has the same mechanics and
      there&#39;s nothing new besides stronger enemies.

          >Its good, visuals and soundtracks are good and characters look great.
          Story is pretty good too. Although I get bored of the gameplay. Its
          just not enough for me to get hooked in. It feels kinda slow for me,
          and thats coming from someone who plays turn based games on the daily.
          Tired of already doing Story quest, then Battle Sims to do even more
          Story Quest. Overall 3.8/5. Gameplays not for me, I got bored of it
          quick</i

    <h2>My problem with Story Mode</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->

    <p>
      In the game, you play the role of a male character named Takt during the
      story mode. The pacing of the story can be somewhat unengaging,
      particularly if you&#39;re seeking swift progression. Conversely, some
      players find the story mode to be captivating. Having viewed the anime
      prior to engaging with the game, I find the leisurely pace of events
      disappointing. The decision to have the main character experience memory
      loss is a drawback for me, as certain references are tied to events from
      the anime, which I am familiar with.
      <strong
        >Moreover, my dissatisfaction extends to the general gameplay
        style</strong
      >. In common with many mobile games, the story mode unfolds within a text
      box situated beneath a character&#39;s upper body, as depicted in the
      image above. This presentation fails to seize my attention and, over time,
      it becomes monotonous. Consequently, my interest is lost and I ultimately
      find myself exiting the game.

    <h3><strong>DESTINY the character-s?</strong></h3>

    <p>
      To start talking about her, we first need to understand what a Musicart
      is. A Musicart is a special kind of alien warrior who used to be human but
      gave up her body to become a weapon. She doesn&#39;t remember her human
      life anymore; she only knows herself as a Musicart. Her main purpose is to
      fight the aliens called despair dolls that threaten humanity. Musicarts
      are based on classical music, like Destiny, who&#39;s named after<strong>
        Beethoven&#39;s Symphony No. 5 in C Minor Op. 67.</strong
      >
      Now, with this in mind, let&#39;s address a question: Why are there two
      characters named Destiny in the game? In the game, there are two
      characters named Destiny, and this might confuse new players. The reason
      for this is that the game has two different timelines. One Destiny is part
      of the game&#39;s main story, while the other was added as a special
      character from the anime. This anime version is the original Destiny, also
      known as Cosette. In the game&#39;s story, Destiny exists using the body
      of<b> Anna Schneider </b>(left) vs. In the anime, Destiny inhabits and is
      known as<b> Cosette Schneider </b>(right). Notice the similar last name?
      That&#39;s because the host bodies are siblings. But you wouldn&#39;t know
      they&#39;re related unless you watched the anime or if someone told you.
      Interestingly, even the characters in the game question who the real
      Destiny is because they&#39;re not sure themselves.
