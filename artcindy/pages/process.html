    <h2>My art Process</h2>
    <p>
      When I create art, I use my iPad and Apple Pencil because it's easy for
      me. I focus mainly on digital art because it's convenient. I get ideas
      from other artists online, like on social media or Pinterest. I like to
      bring my characters to life, giving them personalities through their
      designs. Sometimes, I work on characters made by other artists that I
      "adopt." I use a program called Procreate and mostly stick to the default
      tools. Occasionally, I use a free brush pack called Jingsketch basics. I
      start with a light or heavy sketch, depending on what I'm drawing.
      Usually, I paint over the sketch, but sometimes I clean it up for neat
      lines. Then, I add flat colors and move on to lighting and shading. If I'm
      doing a painting, I focus on shades and colors first, worrying about
      details later. I use several layers, usually between 8 to 20 or more. If
      I'm making art for someone else, I touch up the final details using the
      liquify tool and add a background. But when it's for me, I often focus on
      character designs and skip making backgrounds since I keep these designs
      for myself.
