    <h2> My Music Intrest</h2>
    <p>I've always been surrounded by different kinds of music, like songs in Spanish, English, and even languages like Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. It all started way back in 2009 when I heard my first Korean song called "Mirotic" by TVXQ. It was on a CD that my older sister got from her friends who liked sharing cool music.Believe it or not, I still listen to that same song today! While I enjoyed exploring various music styles, there were a couple of types I just couldn't stand: country and heavy metal or rock. I couldn't understand why some people liked music with loud screaming sounds.</p>
    


<p1>But as I got older, my taste in music started to change. I got really into EDM (that's electronic dance music) and soundtrack music (like the music in movies). Then, I began to like other styles too, such as rap, reggaeton, R&B, and even classical pieces.</p1>   
  
<p2>And you know what's funny? These days, I've actually grown to like metal and rock music. It's kind of ironic! But there's one thing that hasn't changedâ€”I still can't bring myself to listen to country music. It's just not my thing!</p2> 
 
<p3> So, my musical journey has been like a big adventure, with lots of twists and turns. I'm always open to listening to new stuff, and who knows, I might even change my mind about country music someday. But for now, I'll stick to the beats and melodies that make me groove and feel good.</p3>
