    <h2> My Game Interests</h2>
    <p>I remeber playing games when I was younger. At first I played Minecraft and a game called Pixel Gun on my tablet. Luckily for me at an era where phone games were at their peak geometry dash, temple run, fruit ninja, plants vs zombies...

      After a while I got my first console which was a playstation 4. I played games like minecraft,COD (hot take my personal favourite is advanced warfare), GTA, MK... It was a completely different experience compared to the games I played on my tablet. I have met a lot of people through games
